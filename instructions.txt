### Requirements
1. As an end user I would like to view a home page with instructions on how to use this site.
2. As an end user I would like to view an about page with information about the company so I know who to contract.
3. As an end user I would like to have a means to log into my account so I can get to work on my issues.
4. As an end user I would like to be able to log out, so that I can close my session and avoid other accidentally using my account.
5. As an end user I would like to specify by team at the company so that I can access my team's board.
### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a new django project in this directory (`~/Code/SDGKU/issue_mgr`).
2. Make sure to create all necessary urlpatterns, views and templates to meet the requirements above.
3. At minimum, your project should have 3 apps: `accounts`, `pages` and `issues`.
### Note
Within the `accounts/models.py` make sure you have these models:
...
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
class Role(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    role = models.ForeignKey(
        Role,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE
    )
    team = models.ForeignKey(
        Team,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE
    )
```
